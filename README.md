# Ashes to Ashes

This game was made for the McGill Game Development Society's monthly game jam in February 2018, under the theme Rebirth. 

## Rules
In this game, help Indra the phoenix catch the foods they like falling from the sky. 
But be careful and avoid sour foods (they hate them) or you will have to start over. 

If you catch enough food, Indra will have the energy to deploy their wings and explore the world.
